# Prediction of Missing items in shopping cart
	Existing research in association mining has focused mainly on how to expedite the search for frequently co-occurring groups of items in “shopping cart” type of transactions.
	This project contributes to the latter task by proposing a technique that uses partial information about the contents of a shopping cart for the prediction of what else the customer is likely to buy i.e. predicting the missing items in shopping cart by calculating the current transaction class and cross checking input items of the transactions with the antecedents of the association rules generated of that particular class.
	It also suggests items based on the offers available at that particular time based on the information of items of the current transaction.
	Our project also recommends some items based on previous transactions of a particular customer i.e. user based prediction.
	The whole project is implemented by a simple user interface where inputs such as customer id, items along with their quantity is taken and predicts items based on generated association rules, offers available and also customers previous history
